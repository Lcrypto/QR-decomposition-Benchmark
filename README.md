# QR-decomposition-Benchmark
The GitHub repository contains a comparison of Serial Modified Gram-Schmidt, Householder (using multi-core CPU and Intel Math Kernel Library, MKL), and Givens (GPU CUDA CuBlas) QR-decomposition methods. This comparison is applied for the purpose of speed-up lattice reduction and solving the Short(est) Basis Problem.

QR decomposition is a crucial operation in many computational applications such as linear regression, signal processing, and optimization. The different methods of QR decomposition offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency and numerical stability.

This repository provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing their implementations of QR decomposition for lattice reduction and Short(est) Basis Problem solutions. The comparison includes both CPU- and GPU-based approaches, making it relevant to a wide range of computing environments.

Overall, this repository offers a comprehensive comparison of different QR decomposition methods that can be used for speeding up lattice reduction and solving the Short(est) Basis Problem. Researchers and practitioners will find the insights and results provided by this comparison valuable in selecting the most efficient QR decomposition method for their specific computational requirements.
